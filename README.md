#   This is my README file
*   I struggled with finding the functions for this project.
*   Working with the tutorials, which showed me what would work and where, helped me learn more. 
*   I used quite a few arrays to produce the various cards and pulled them from the deck for the card draws
*   I was having issues with the card count not matching but it seems okay now
*   I wanted to add a "Tie" option but didn't think about it until late in the project
*   This works on the DOM and on mobile (as far as I could tell with inspecting the page)
